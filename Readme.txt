Assignment 6 - Michael Falgien - JsonRPC Enabled iOS app

This app uses swift 3 to navigate a collection of place description in iOS from a JsonRPC server. 

This app is a single view application to provide the user with a better UX by everything being on the main page. A user can browse the collection of places by clicking on the name text area, which will populate a pickerview with the names of the places. Upon selecting a new place, the view will be updated with the new information.

Adding and deleting entries can be done by clicking the buttons on the page. Adding an entry will add the values of all of the text fields except for the name. The user must first edit the text fields to the desired values and then click "add". This will prompt the user to enter the name of the place and add to the server. To delete an entry, simply click delete and the current place being viewed will be deleted.
